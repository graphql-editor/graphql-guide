# Deploy using GraphQL Editor

You can write small microservices inside the editor microservices Code Tab. It is not a full-featured IDE, however, you can create some basic field resolvers there and bind them to serverless functions. It is enough for example to write integration code.

Right now microservices can be written in TypeScript and Javascript. Our editor also supports `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` out of the box. If you have a build script you should provide it during deployment inside popup.
