# Microservices FaaS

## Getting started

To deploy your first microservice you need a schema with a query root. Let's not start with a simple to-do app but instead let's create something more challenging.

Remember. Your schema has to have a root query for GraphQL backends to work
{% endhint %}

### Use cases

Shared worker deployments should be used in dev environments or MVP projects. They are limited to 200 requests/minute.
