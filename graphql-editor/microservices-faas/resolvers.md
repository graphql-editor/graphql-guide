# Resolvers

To do so please navigate to the resolvers screen in the microservices section. Then please provide paths of your resolvers to each GraphQL field you want to be resolved.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use any build system, please provide paths to built files. For example, you can have a file `src/Query/people.ts` but it will output to `lib/Query/people.js` so you should provide `lib/Query/people.js`
{% endhint %}
