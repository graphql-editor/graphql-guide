# Deploy from repository

Inspired by frontend deployment platforms we have created an easy experience. To deploy your backend code to our shared workers. To deploy your code you need call:\


```
npx graphql-editor-cli deploy
```

It will trigger the deployment to serverless GraphQL functions and provide logs for this deployment.
