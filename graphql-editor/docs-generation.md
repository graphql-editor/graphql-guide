# Docs Generation

### Browsing docs

All descriptions inside a schema are rendered with a remark markdown engine. After clicking a type inside the Table of Contents the interface should scroll down to that field. If you click on the type inside a field it will navigate you to the page containing the documentation of the clicked type.
