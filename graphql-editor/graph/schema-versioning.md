# Schema versioning

GraphQL Editor lets you deploy multiple versions of your schema. Controlling the process of versioning makes it so much easier to keep your backend consistent and up-to-date. After the version is deployed the schema and the graph inside become read-only.

To deploy a new version from the schema, open the version menu, and click **deploy a new version**.

To open a version, open the versions menu and click the desired version.

{% hint style="info" %}
latest version is the only editable version
{% endhint %}
