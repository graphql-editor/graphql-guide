# Generate TypeScript/Javascript Client library

GraphQL Editor offers an easy way to generate autocomplete JS/TS clients for Browser/Node/React Native. Working with a generated client provides an easy and **type-safe** way for developers to work with thier schema. To generate an autocomplete library your schema should have at least a **root schema Query type.**

To generate a GraphQL Client:

1. Click Generate Autocomplete libraries
2. Select JS/TS
3. Generate

When generating Javascript libraries you should also generate typings for type-safe JS.
