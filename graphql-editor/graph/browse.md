# Graph

Browsing a big GraphQL Schema with code only is nearly impossible. Instead, you should use our diagram view to browse it.

### Relations

For displaying relations we created a special **Relation View**_,_ selectable on the left. As you can see, after selecting a node all related nodes are highlighted.

If you click **focus** button selected node will attract other connected nodes

### Diagram View

Diagram view is used to **create** schema and **view** deep tree of GraphQL

### Hierarchy view

Hierarchy view is used to display the relation between type and its field. It is also good to take screenshots from it and use them in docs/presentation
