# Browse

Browsing a big GraphQL Schema with code only is nearly impossible. Instead, you should use our diagram view to browse it.

### Relations

For displaying relations we created a special **Relation View**_,_ selectable on the left. As you can see, after selecting a node all related nodes are highlighted.

### Expand field type

Browsing a big schema often boils down to navigating from one type to another. What happens if they turn out to be in totally different parts of code? It may take a lot of time and effort to locate all you need. An editor can make your work easier and more efficient by expanding the type of every field.

However, this is a behavior you would normally expect from a standard code editor. With GraphQL Editor we went a step further: here you can expand far more without losing the whole context.

### Input types and field arguments

Using the + on the left side of the field you can expand/add input values for your field.
