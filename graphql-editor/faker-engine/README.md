# Cloud

### API Platform

The API platform is a tree-based GraphQL query builder. It allows building queries with mouse clicks and inputting data in user-friendly forms. All of that you can collaborate LIVE. If you prefer old way of working use **GraphiQL Cloud**

### Instant Mock Backend

Deploy it in seconds. The mock backend allows you to query your GraphQL Schema and get type-safe responses. If it is not enough it allows configuring the method of response mocking. =

### E2E Tests Builder

Writing tests is a long and boring process. This builder allows you to click out e2e tests for your GraphQL backend.

### REST to GraphQL

Is your API still REST? That's good because you can click out the proxy very fast using that tool.

Remember. Your schema has to have a root query for GraphQL backends to work
