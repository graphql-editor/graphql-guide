# Instant Fake backend

To use and test a fake backend navigate to GraphQL Cloud via the top menu or (CTRL + K, C, C). It should automatically deploy your fake backend or warn you that something is incorrect with your schema. If you see the input you are good to go.

### Faker configuration

To configure faker, navigate to the faker configuration tab inside Cloud. You can set two types of value faking. One is using a **faker key** and another one is to input **values** and let the faker randomly choose from them. After saving the configuration, the faker engine will automatically update.
