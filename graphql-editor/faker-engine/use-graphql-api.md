### CORS

If you just want to test your API with GraphQL Editor you don't have to worry about CORS. Every request to your GraphQL API is proxied via our service to ensure a lack of CORS issues.

### localhost

It is possible to connect to the API you are serving locally. Just type the localhost URL and it should work with your local backend.
