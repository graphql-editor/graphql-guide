# Projects

### Create a project

To create a project, click the empty tile inside your **Workspace** projects list. It will open a popup with options you can use for your GraphQL project

#### Import from URL

GraphQL schema can be downloaded via introspection from your GraphQL Endpoint. Don't worry about CORS as the editor handles it via the backend Proxy.

#### GitHub connection

The project can be connected to your GitHub repo from the very beginning. It will allow you to commit changes to the schema and create Pull Requests from GraphQL Editor.&#x20;

Both importing from URL and GitHub can be done later in the project

#### I want to use

In this category, you can attach directive sets to your project. Each of the technologies listed there works only if the library is attached.

&#x20;After setting all the options click **Create Project**.
